      <h3>How the brain works</h3>  
    </hgroup>
    <aside class="note">
      <section>
        <p> Why? Because a computer is designed to multitask. When a computer switches from performing one task to another, it saves the entire state of the task being switched out, enabling the computer to literally pick up where it left of when it returns to that task.</p>

    </aside>
    <article>
      <ul class="build">
        <li>Computers are much better at multi-tasking than humans are</li>
	    <li>Humans aren’t wired that way</li>
        <li>New information must reside in short term memory for a length of time before it is moved into long term memory</li>
        <li>That is why cramming for an exam may get you a better grade but you may remember little of the material two weeks later</li>
        <li>It's just too hard to retain the last thing you worked on before the context switch</li>

    </hgroup>
    <aside class="note">
      <section>
        <p>It is doing it all day long. It even does it at night. There are many parts of the brain that are working together and alone all the time. We could not function in our complex environments otherwise. Most of the multitasking is subconscious – filtering of sensory input, integration of related information, moving data from short term to long term memory, keeping the heart and lungs going. Driving the car while we navigate and listen to the traffic reports, talking on the phone while we make dinner, planning vacation while we are weeding the garden.</p>

        <li>The human brain multitasks internally all the time</li>

        <li>So how is this translated to software development?</li>

      <h3>Effect on software development</h3>
    </hgroup>
    <aside class="note">
      <section>
        <p>Programmers keep a lot in their heads during the act of programming, like how the code will be organized, what data structures are being used, the naming and use of variables, all of which is centered on the act of translating business requirements into detailed instructions for the computer to follow.</p>

    <article>
      <ul class="build">
        <li>Unfortunately software development isn’t that simple</li>
	    <li>It requires keeping a lot of details in your head along with applying some creative thought</li>
        <li>Mental focus and concentration is essential</li>
        <li>A person who works on more than one project incurs a cost at each shift from one project to the other</li>
        <li>The more complex the task, the more time it takes to make the shift [6]</li>

	    <li>There is evidence that multitasking actually degrades short term memory, not just for the topics being multitasked but possibly by impacting areas of the brain
        <ul class="build">
            <li>Multitasking creates stress</li>
            <li>Stress invokes the more primitive parts of the brain that are concerned with personal safety, pulling energy from the more modern parts concerned with higher level thinking [1]</li>
            <li>Stress can also damage cells needed for new memories [2]</li>

        <li>We are more prone to errors when we multitask so the quality of our work results goes down [3]</li>

        <p>As a focused team, all of the daily activities are targeted at a narrow band of functionality and technology. Only a few stories are being worked on at a time. The context is narrow even though the range of activities is varied. Additionally, Agile has a number of devices for keeping focus – collaboration, task boards, automated testing, retrospection. It is the wide jumps in context that make trouble – other projects, other collaborators, other stakeholders.</p>

        <li>The answer has to do with the scope of context</li>

	    <li>If the switch is small, it suits the way we think and it can work just fine</li>
